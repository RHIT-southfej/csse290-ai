/*
Stage 1 rules:
- In a game, there are four players, and each player has a pile of chess pieces in front of them.
- Players start with five random chess pieces in their piles.
- There is a massive Unowned pile of chess pieces in the middle of all players.
- In the game, there are a total of 64 chess pieces, of equal amounts of the colors red, blue, green, and yellow.
- There is a single chess piece drawn from these 64 pieces in the Discard pile.

Stage 2 rules:
Stage 2 rules:
- Each turn, a player can take only one of three actions: Discard a piece, Draw a piece, or Forfeit the game.
- To Discard a piece, the chess piece discarded must either match the color of the last chess piece added to the Discard pile, or match the kind of chess piece that it is. Otherwise, it cannot be discarded, and the player must discard a different piece.
- If a player cannot discard a piece according to any rules of the game, then they must instead select a new piece from the Unowned pile to draw, with their eyes open.
- A player must always Discard a piece if they can; they cannot simply Draw if they just feel like it.
- If a player ever needs to Draw from the Unowned pile and that pile is empty, then that player can only Forfeit the game.
- A player who Forfeits is removed from the player rotation.
- When a player successfully discards all their pieces from their pile according to the rules of the game, then they win the game.
- If, after a Forfeit, only one player is left in the game, then that last remaining player automatically wins, even if their only option would be to Forfeit.

Stage 3 rules:
Stage 3 rules:
- There is a new color of chess piece: rainbow, and there are now 80 chess pieces at the start of a new game.
- Rainbow-colored pieces can always be discarded, regardless of the color of the last discarded chess piece.
- Whenever a Rainbow-colored piece is discarded, the turn order of the game reverses.
- Rainbow-colored pieces are their own color for all other intents and purposes.

Stage 4 rules:
Stage 4 rules:
- If you have at least five pieces of the same color in your pile and hold more pieces of that color than any other player, you gain a Monopoly over that color.
- While you hold a Monopoly over a color, you can always elect to Draw an available Pawn of the Monopolized color from the Unowned pile, in lieu of any other action you would normally be forced to take.
- You can only hold one Monopoly; it is always over the color that you hold the most pieces of.
- If another player ever gains more pieces of the Monopolized color in their pile than you have in your pile, you lose your Monopoly to the other player.
